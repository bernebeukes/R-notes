##Example 1 

#We will be considering the txhousing data then we seperate the information for each city and save them in different xcell files 
library(tidyverse)
library(writexl)
library(readxl)
library(purrr)

#Using txhousing from ggplot
ggplot2 :: txhousing 

#Create the directory where the files needs to be saves
dir.create("txhousing")

#Create one excel file 

writexl :: write_xlsx(txhousing, path = "txhousing/txhousing.xlsx")

####Function to create multiple excell files 

write_ex_file = function(city_name){
 txhousing %>% filter(city==city_name) %>%
 writexl::write_xlsx(path =
paste0("txhousing/txhousing_",city_name,".xlsx"))
}

#list of uniques city names 

list_city = unique(txhousing$city)

####Loop to create multiple excel files
purrr::map(.x = list_city,write_ex_file)

##Example 2 

#The exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) scheme is a process monitoirng
#scheme. For every 𝑋𝑡 at time point 𝑡, we obtain 𝑍𝑡 = 𝜆𝑋𝑡 + (1 − 𝜆)𝑍(𝑡−1)
#. We obtain
#𝑍1, 𝑍2, . . . , 𝑍200 for 𝑋𝑡 ∼ 𝑁(0,1) and repeat the steps 2000 times. Then we have a
#2000 × 200 matrix of EWMA values. Then this whole process is repeated for 20 times to
#obtain 20 such matrices.
#It can be done very easily if we write this iteration process as a function. The example is
#given below.

lambda = 0.2 # EWMA smoothing parameter
n1 = 5 # subgroup size

write_file = function(value){
 EWMA.values = array(NA,dim = c(2000,200))
 ## vary the lambda value for lambda = 0.1,0.15,0.2,0.25,...,0.9,0.95 and
 ## store the matrix of EWMA values in separate excel sheets for each
#lambda.
 IC.sample = rnorm(ncol(EWMA.values))
 mu = 0
 for(i in 1:nrow(EWMA.values)){
 for(j in 1:ncol(EWMA.values)){
 if(j>1){
 spl = sample(IC.sample,n1,replace = T)
 EWMA.values[i,j] = lambda*mean(spl)+(1-lambda)*EWMA.values[i,(j-1)]
 }else{
 EWMA.values[i,j] = 0
 }
 }
 }
 EWMA.values = data.frame(EWMA.values)
writexl::write_xlsx( EWMA.values,path =
paste0("bootstrap_EWMA/EWMA_values_lambda=0.2_",value,".xlsx"))
}

write_file(0.2)
list_values = c(1:20)
purrr::map(.x = list_values, .f = write_file)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
