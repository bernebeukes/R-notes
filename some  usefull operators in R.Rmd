```{r}
#Assignment operator: <- or = are used to assign values to variables

#Comparison operators: == (equal to) != (not equal to)

#Logical operators: & (and) | (Or) !(not) are used or combine logical expressions
#Exp x > 3 & y < 5

#Arithmic operators: + - * / 
#Modelus operators: %% returns the remainder of division  

###%in% checks if an element is present in a vector

###%>% is used in tidyverse packages to chain functions togheter 

#Colon operator ':' creates a sequence of numbers 



####The %in% operator 

# Define two vectors

x <- c(1, 3, 5, 7)
y <- c(2, 4, 6, 8)
# Check which elements of x are in y
x %in% y

# Define a new vector
z <- c(2, 4, 5, 8)

# Check which elements of x are in z
x %in% z

# Check which elements of z are in y
z %in% y

###The pipe operator 

library(dplyr)

# Select the columns "mpg" and "cyl" from the mtcars dataset,
# filter for cars with 6 cylinders or more,
# sort the results by mpg in descending order,
# and select the top 3 rows
top_cars <- mtcars %>%
 select(mpg, cyl) %>%
 filter(cyl >= 6) %>%
 arrange(desc(mpg)) %>%
 head(3)
# Print the top_cars dataframe
top_car

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
